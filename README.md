## Documentation

To save todos after inputting the todo title, the user can either click the circle button in the input or press enter.

If the todo already exists and error message will be displayed and the user will need to enter a new todo

To mark a todo as complete, hover over the circle button to the left of the todo and click it.

To delete a todo, click the close button to the right of the todo.

Users may filter todos by completion status, using the filter buttons at the bottom of the todo list.

A user may delete all completed todos by clicking the clear completed button at the the bottom of the todo list.

## Learnings

Building out this project allowed me to go back to the basics, without any packages, and just focus on the fundamentals.

I was able to take a step back and really appreciate the nuances of React again.

I used Styled Components for styling the project; which was a new component library to me. This was the first time I had used any CSS-in-JS, so using that for the first time was an amazing learning opportunity.

I also interacted with the drag-and-drop API for the first time. After a few bugs, and starting over on the feature a few times; I was able to implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder my todos.

## Future Features and Improvements

In the future, I would like to add a feature to swipe one direction to delete, and to swipe the other direction to complete your todo.

I would also like to add backend functionality, to persist todos across sessions through the use of a database.
